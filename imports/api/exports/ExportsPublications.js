// INFORMATION FOR LOUIS: Tasks.find(), we will get every task in the collection. Thatâ€™s not good if our application users want to store private and sensitive data. We need to control which data Meteor sends to the client-side database.
// in the back : Meteor.publish: allows the data to be published from the server to the client;
// in the front : Meteor.subscribe: allows the client code to ask for data.

import { Meteor } from 'meteor/meteor';
import { ExportsCollection } from '/imports/db/exports/ExportsCollection';

Meteor.publish('exports', function publishExports() {
  return ExportsCollection.find({ userId: this.userId });
